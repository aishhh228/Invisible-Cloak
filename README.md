# Invisible-Cloak
If you are a Harry Potter fan , you would know what an Invisibility Cloak is. Yes! It’s the cloak that makes Harry Potter invisible.


I have created my own ‘Invisibility Cloak’ using simple computer vision techniques in OpenCV.

How it works:

1.Capture and store the background frame

2.Detect the defined color using color detection and segmentation algorithm.

3.Segment out the defined colored part by generating a mask.

4.Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.

In order to run this code , you need a mp4 video named "video.mp4".
You must have a cloth of same color and no other color should be there. I am using red cloth. 
If you are taking some other cloth , the code will remain the same but with minute changes.
